## *About me*
###### Before I signed up for the RSchool courses, I was not engaged in programming. I have been working in medicine for 13 years. Of these, I have been working in intensive care and anesthesiology for the last 10 years. Previously, I only read thematic articles on programming on the Internet, tried to write something in C++ in MSVS. Further, with the advent of the Internet at an affordable price, I began to read about the creation of websites, servers, and the organization of the Internet. At first it was just a hobby. But over time, I was drawn into it more and more. I started watching examples of creating websites on Youtube, tried to make up in VSCode and WebStorm, wrote the simplest Node server and tried to connect to the Mongo DB database. I finally decided to deepen my knowledge and try to learn Front-End development.
